# FlexASIO Configuration

**Tip: instead of editing the FlexASIO configuration file directly, you might
find it easier to use a third-party tool such as flipswitchingmonkey's
[FlexASIO GUI][FlexASIO_GUI].**

FlexASIO does not provide an official graphical interface ([GUI][]) to adjust
its settings. This is because developing a GUI typically requires a
significant amount of developer time that FlexASIO, sadly, doesn't have.
This explains why nothing happens when you click on the ASIO driver
"configure" or "settings" button in your application.

Instead, FlexASIO settings can be specified using a
[configuration file][]. FlexASIO will search for a file named
`FlexASIO.toml` directly inside your Windows user profile folder; for
example: `C:\Users\Your Name\FlexASIO.toml`.

If the file is missing, this is equivalent to supplying an empty file,
and as a result FlexASIO will use default values for everything.

The configuration file is a text file that can be edited using any text editor,
such as Notepad. The file follows the [TOML][] syntax, which is very similar to
the syntax used for [INI files][]. Every feature described in the [official TOML documentation] should be supported.

FlexASIO will silently ignore attempts to set options that don't exist,
so beware of typos. However, if an existing option is set to an invalid
value (which includes using the wrong type or missing quotes), FlexASIO
will *fail to initialize*. The [FlexASIO log][logging] will contain details
about what went wrong.

While running, FlexASIO watches for changes to the configuration file. If a
change is detected and the new file contains a valid, different configuration,
FlexASIO will automatically issue a reset request to the ASIO application. What
happens next is up to the application; ideally, it should reload FlexASIO and
pick up the new configuration.

## Example configuration file

```toml
# Use WASAPI as the PortAudio host API backend.
backend = "Windows WASAPI"

[input]
# Disable the input. It is strongly recommended to do this if you only want to
# stream audio in one direction.
device = ""

[output]
# Select the output device. The name comes from the output of the
# PortAudioDevices program.
device = "Speakers (Realtek High Definition Audio)"

# Open the hardware output device with 6 channels. This is only required if you
# are unhappy with the default channel count.
channels = 6

# Set the output to WASAPI Exclusive Mode.
wasapiExclusiveMode = true
```

Experimentally, the following set of options has been shown to be a good
starting point for low latency operation:

```toml
backend = "Windows WASAPI"
bufferSizeSamples = 128

[input]
suggestedLatencySeconds = 0.0
wasapiExclusiveMode = true

[output]
suggestedLatencySeconds = 0.0
wasapiExclusiveMode = true
```

## Options reference

### Global section

These options are outside of any section ("table" in TOML parlance), and affect
both input and output streams.

#### Option `backend`

*String*-typed option that determines which audio backend FlexASIO will attempt
to use. In PortAudio parlance, this is called the *host API*. FlexASIO uses the
term "backend" to avoid potential confusion with the term "ASIO host".

This is by far the most important option in FlexASIO. Changing the backend can
have wide-ranging consequences on the operation of the entire audio pipeline.
For more information, see [BACKENDS][].

The value of the option is matched against PortAudio host API names, as
shown in the output of the [`PortAudioDevices` program][PortAudioDevices]. If
the specified name doesn't match any host API, FlexASIO will fail to initialize.

In practice, PortAudio will recognize the following names: `MME`,
`Windows DirectSound`, `Windows WASAPI` and `Windows WDM-KS`.

Example:

```toml
backend = "Windows WASAPI"
```

The default behaviour is to use DirectSound.

#### Option `bufferSizeSamples`

*Integer*-typed option that determines which ASIO buffer size (in samples)
FlexASIO will suggest to the ASIO Host application.

This option, in combination with
[`suggestedLatencySeconds`][suggestedLatencySeconds],
can have a major impact on reliability and latency. Smaller buffers will reduce
latency but will increase the likelihood of glitches/discontinuities (buffer
overflow/underrun) if the audio pipeline is not fast enough.

Note that some host applications might already provide a user-controlled buffer
size setting; in this case, there should be no need to use this option. It is
useful only when the application does not provide a way to customize the buffer
size.

The ASIO buffer size is also used as the PortAudio "front" (user) buffer size,
as FlexASIO bridges the two. Note that, for various technical reasons and
depending on the backend and settings used (especially the
[`suggestedLatencySeconds` option][suggestedLatencySeconds]), there are many
scenarios where additional buffers will be inserted in the audio pipeline
(either by PortAudio or by Windows itself), *in addition* to the ASIO buffer.
This can result in overall latency being higher than what the ASIO buffer size
alone would suggest.

Example:

```toml
bufferSizeSamples = 1920 # 40 ms at 48 kHz
```

The default behaviour is to advertise minimum, preferred and maximum buffer
sizes of 1 ms, 20 ms and 1 s, respectively. However, in practice the minimum
buffer size will be advertised as 10 ms as long as the (default) DirectSound
backend is used and the input device isn't disabled; this is to work around a
[known issue][issue50] with DirectSound and small input buffer sizes. The
resulting sizes in samples are computed based on whatever sample rate the driver
is set to when the application enquires. In addition, by default, FlexASIO will
not advertise any buffer sizes smaller than 32 samples as that tends to [confuse
some applications][issue88].

### `[input]` and `[output]` sections

Options in this section only apply to the *input* (capture, recording) audio
stream or to the *output* (rendering, playback) audio stream, respectively.

#### Option `device`

*String*-typed option that determines which hardware audio device FlexASIO will
attempt to use.

The value of the option is the *full name* of the device. The list of available
device names is shown by the [`PortAudioDevices` program][PortAudioDevices]. The
value of this option must exactly match the "Device name" shown by
`PortAudioDevices`, including any text in parentheses. If the device name
contains non-ASCII characters (e.g. accents), make sure the configuration file
is written in UTF-8.

**Note:** only devices that match the selected [*backend*][BACKENDS] will be
considered. In other words, the "Host API name" as shown in the output of
`PortAudioDevices` has to match the value of the [`backend` option][backend].
Beware that a given hardware device will not necessarily have the same name
under different backends.

If you want FlexASIO to track whatever device is set as "default" in the Windows
audio device settings, switching automatically and transparently as the default
device changes while streaming, then use the relevant "virtual" device from a
backend that supports this feature. For more information, see
[BACKENDS][BACKENDS]. Note that the default device for the default backend
behaves like this by default.

The WASAPI backend provides extra "mirror" devices whose names end
with `[Loopback]`. These virtual devices can be used to record whatever audio
is being played through the corresponding output device. For more information,
see the [WASAPI backend documentation][WASAPI].

If the specified name doesn't match any device under the selected backend,
FlexASIO will fail to initialize.

If the option is set to the empty string (`""`), no device will be used; that
is, the input or output side of the stream will be disabled, and all other
options in the section will be ignored. Making your ASIO Host Application
unselect all input channels or all output channels will achieve the same result.

**Note:** using both input and output devices (full duplex mode) puts additional
constraints on the [backend][BACKENDS] due to the need to synchronize buffer
delivery. It makes discontinuities (glitches) more likely and increases the
lowest achievable latency. It is recommended to only use a single device (half
duplex mode) if possible.

Example:

```toml
[input]
device = ""

[output]
device = "Speakers (Realtek High Definition Audio)"
```

The default behaviour is to use the default device for the selected backend.
`PortAudioDevices` will show which device that is. Typically, this would be the
device set as default in the Windows audio control panel.

#### Option `deviceRegex`

This option is identical to `device` (see above) except that it supports
matching device names using a [C++-flavored ECMAScript regular expression][].
This is useful in (rare) situations where the full name of the device is not
known in advance.

Most users are unlikely to find this option useful, and will likely want to use
`device` instead.

The regex is evaluated against the exact device name string that one would use
as the value of the `device` option, including the parentheses. By default the
regex is not anchored; use `^` and `$` to match the full device name.

You will likely want to enclose the regex in single quotes (`'`) instead of
double quotes (`"`) as that makes it easier to escape regex metacharacters. For
example, when using single quoting, you can write `\(` and `\)` to match
parentheses literally.

If the regex matches multiple device names, FlexASIO will fail to initialize.

If `device` and `deviceRegex` are specified at the same time, FlexASIO will fail
to initialize.

Unlike `device`, if this option is set to the empty string (`""`), FlexASIO will
fail to initialize.

Example:

```toml
[input]
# Will match "FooBar", "_Foo_Bar_", "Foo123Bar", etc.
deviceRegex = 'Foo.*Bar'

[output]
# Will match "Foo_(Bar)", "Foo123(Bar)", etc., but not "Foo(Bar)", "_Foo_(Bar)_", etc.
deviceRegex = '^Foo.+\(Bar\)$'
```

#### Option `channels`

*Integer*-typed option that determines how many channels FlexASIO will open the
hardware audio device with. This is the number of channels the ASIO Host
Application will see.

**Note:** even if the ASIO Host Application only decides to use a subset of the
available channels, the hardware audio device will still be opened with the
number of channels configured here. In other words, the host application has no
control over the hardware channel configuration. The only exception is if the
application does not request any input channels, or any output channels; in this
case the input or output device (respectively) won't be opened at all.

If the requested channel count doesn't match what the audio device is configured
for, the resulting behaviour depends on the backend. Some backends will accept
any channel count, upmixing or downmixing as necessary. Other backends might
refuse to initialize.

The value of this option must be strictly positive. To completely disable the
input or output, set the [`device` option][device] to the empty string.

**Note:** with the WASAPI backend, setting this option has the side effect of
disabling channel masks. This means channel names will not be shown, and the
backend might behave differently with regard to channel routing.

Example:

```toml
[input]
channels = 2

[output]
channels = 6
```

The default behaviour is to use the maximum channel count for the selected
device as reported by PortAudio. This information is shown in the output of the
[`PortAudioDevices` program][PortAudioDevices]. Sadly, PortAudio often gets the
channel count wrong, so setting this option explicitly might be necessary for
correct operation.

#### Option `sampleType`

*String*-typed option that determines which sample format FlexASIO will use with
this device.

FlexASIO itself doesn't do any kind of sample type conversion; therefore, this
option determines the type of samples on the ASIO side as well as the PortAudio
side.

**Note:** however, PortAudio *does* support transparent sample type conversion
internally. If this option is set to a sample type that the device cannot be
opened with, PortAudio will *automatically* and *implicitly* convert to the
"closest" type that works. Sadly, this cannot be disabled, which means it's
impossible to be sure what sample type is actually used in the PortAudio
backend, aside from examining the [FlexASIO log][logging]. The only exception is
when operating in WASAPI Exclusive mode - see the [`wasapiExplicitSampleFormat`
option][wasapiExplicitSampleFormat].

The valid values are:

 - `Float32`: 32-bit IEEE floating point
 - `Int32`: 32-bit signed integer
 - `Int24`: 24-bit signed integer
 - `Int16`: 16-bit signed integer

**Note:** it makes sense to choose a specific type when using a
[backend][BACKENDS] that goes directly to the hardware, bypassing the Windows
audio engine (e.g. WASAPI Exclusive, WDM-KS). In other cases, it usually does
not make sense to choose a type other than 32-bit float, because that's what the
Windows audio pipeline uses internally, so any other type would just get
converted to 32-bit float eventually.

**Caution:** it is recommended to always use the same sample type for both input
and output (i.e. use the same configuration option in both `[input]` and
`[output]` sections). While the ASIO API allows different channels to use
different sample types, in practice this is not a well-tested case and some
applications (e.g. Pro Tools) [do not handle it well][issue87].

Example:

```toml
[input]
sampleType = "Int16"

[output]
sampleType = "Int16"
```

The default value is `Float32`, except in WASAPI Exclusive mode, where FlexASIO
will try to guess the native sample type of the hardware and use that as the
default. Note that, in that case, as explained above, you might want to ensure
both input and output devices are using the same sample type.

#### Option `suggestedLatencySeconds`

*Floating-point*-typed option that determines the amount of audio latency (in
seconds) that FlexASIO will "suggest" to PortAudio. Typically, this has the
effect of increasing the amount of additional buffering that PortAudio will
introduce in the audio pipeline in addition to the ASIO buffer itself (see
[`bufferSizeSamples`][bufferSizeSamples]). As a result, this option can have a
major impact on reliability and latency.

The value of this option is only a hint; the resulting latency can be very
different from the value of this option. PortAudio [backends][BACKENDS]
interpret this setting in complicated and confusing ways, and it interacts
strongly with the ASIO buffer size, so it is recommended to experiment with
various values.

Setting this option to `0.0` will request the lowest possible latency that
PortAudio can provide for the selected buffer size.

**Note:** using both input and output devices (full duplex mode) puts more
buffering constraints on the backend due to synchronization requirements. Using
a low suggested latency value in this case is likely to cause audio
discontinuities (glitches). This is less of a problem when using a single device
(half duplex mode).

Example:

```toml
[output]
suggestedLatencySeconds = 0.050 # 50 ms
```

The default value is 3 times the ASIO buffer length.

#### Option `wasapiExclusiveMode`

*Boolean*-typed option that determines if the stream should be opened in
*WASAPI Shared* or in *WASAPI Exclusive* mode. For more information, see
the [WASAPI backend documentation][WASAPI].

This option is ignored if the backend is not WASAPI. See the
[`backend` option][backend].

Example:

```toml
backend = "Windows WASAPI"

[input]
wasapiExclusiveMode = true
```

The default behaviour is to open the stream in *shared* mode.

#### Option `wasapiAutoConvert`

*Boolean*-typed option that determines if WASAPI Shared is allowed to convert
the sample rate and channel count of the audio stream.

This option is ignored if the backend is not WASAPI. See the
[`backend` option][backend]. Furthermore, it is only effective when WASAPI is
used in *Shared mode*; WASAPI never converts *Exclusive mode* streams. See the
[`wasapiExclusiveMode` option][wasapiExclusiveMode].

If set to `true`, WASAPI will automatically convert the stream's sample rate
and channel count (upmixing/downmixing) if it doesn't match the *shared format*,
i.e. the format configured in the Windows audio control panel for that device.

If set to `false`, WASAPI will not do any sample rate and channel count
conversions and will only accept streams whose sample rate and channel count
match the one configured in the Windows audio control panel for that device. If
the sample rate or channel count don't match, FlexASIO will fail to initialize.
Note that WASAPI Shared might still do additional processing besides sample rate
and channel count conversion (e.g. sample format conversions, mixing, APOs).

Example:

```toml
backend = "Windows WASAPI"

[output]
wasapiAutoConvert = false
```

The default behaviour is to allow conversions.

(Note: as explained in [BACKENDS][], in modern versions of Windows, DirectSound
and MME use WASAPI Shared behind the scenes, and they implicitly enable the same
automatic conversion mechanism as the one this option controls.)

#### Option `wasapiExplicitSampleFormat`

*Boolean*-typed option that determines if PortAudio is allowed to implicitly
convert between sample types when using WASAPI Exclusive.

This option is only meaningful when the [`backend` option][backend] option
is set to WASAPI and the [`wasapiExclusiveMode` option][wasapiExclusiveMode] is
set to exclusive mode. In all other cases, implicit sample type conversion is
always active and cannot be disabled.

If set to `true`, the underlying WASAPI stream will be configured according to
the [`sampleType` option][sampleType], and PortAudio will not do any sample type
conversions. If the underlying device doesn't support the requested sample type,
initialization will fail. This can be used to guarantee "bit-perfect" operation.

If set to `false`, PortAudio will attempt to open a WASAPI stream with the
configured sample type. If that fails, PortAudio will automatically try other
sample types and, if it finds one that works, will convert samples on-the-fly.
This means that the actual sample type of the underlying WASAPI stream might
differ from the sample type used at the ASIO interface level, and the resulting
audio pipeline will not be "bit-perfect".

In general, there is little reason to allow implicit sample type conversions
between the ASIO Host application and WASAPI unless you have a specific need for
such conversions.

Example:

```toml
backend = "Windows WASAPI"

[output]
wasapiExclusiveMode = true
wasapiExplicitSampleFormat = false
sampleType = "Int24"
```

The default behaviour is to disallow implicit conversions.
